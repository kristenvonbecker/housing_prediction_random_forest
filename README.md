# Housing Price EDA and Prediction: Random Forest Regression

This project uses a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data) (created December 18, 2023) containing U.S. real estate data obtained from [realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/).

It includes basic data analysis (summary statistics, distributions, correlation, data formatting, handling of missing values, outlier detection), as well as prediction using Scikit-Learn's `RandomForestRegressor()` model.
